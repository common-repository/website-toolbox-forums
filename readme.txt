== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't allow registration on my WordPress site, can I still use the community? =

Yes. If you don't have registration enabled on your WordPress site, your users can register an account directly on the community. If you want users to be able to post without registering, you can simply enable guest posting or you can disable the User Accounts feature entirely so users don't even see the registration option.

= What features are available? =

Please take our <a href="https://www.websitetoolbox.com/wordpress/features" target="_blank">features tour</a>.

= Is this a self-hosted community? =

You install the plugin on your WordPress website, and the community is hosted by us at Website Toolbox. As your community grows, you won't have to worry about buying and  maintaining overloaded servers, databases, software, backup solutions, etc. We do all the work, so you can reap all the rewards. You can easily use your current domain name for the community and customize your community to match your website layout. Our WordPress plugin also allows you to easily embed the community into a page of your WordPress website. This makes Website Toolbox completely invisible to your users!
